# Machine Coding Questions

A collection of **interview-style React challenges** — each implemented as a standalone mini-app and wired together with React Router. Great for practice or as reference solutions.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── main.tsx          # Router setup + DATA routes
├── App.tsx           # Home page (grid of feature cards)
├── helper.tsx        # Route config (DATA), getTitle(), shared utilities
├── components/       # Layout, FeatureCard
└── modules/          # One folder per challenge (ColorExplorer, Authentication, etc.)
```

Add a route to `DATA` in `helper.tsx` — it becomes a real route and automatically appears on the home grid.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install && bun dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

```bash
bun build   # Production build → dist/
bun lint    # ESLint check
```
